# Dictionary Database Repository

This repository hosts Dictionary's database containing:

- Regex Patterns
- Custom Formats
- Quality Profiles

The database serves two main purposes:

1. Powers our website and wiki documentation
2. Provides import files for the Profilarr application

## Branches

### Stable

Contains thoroughly tested and verified database entries ready for production use. All entries have gone through our quality assurance process.

### Nightly

Contains the latest updates and additions that are pending verification. May include experimental patterns and profiles that require further testing.

### Feature Branches

Used for developing and testing new database entries, patterns, or major changes before merging into nightly. These branches follow the naming convention: `feature/description-of-change`
