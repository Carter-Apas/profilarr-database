The database serves two main purposes:


Hey everyone. We have had a lot of questions about anime profiles within Profilarr since one does not exist. As such, I have created this repo with a 1080p anime profile.



## Why Does This Exist?

My issue with getting a pre-existing anime quality profile from someone else is that I want to remain true to the Dictionarry philosophy but with the small addition of anime for those who need it. With someone else's repo, I have to use their **entire** repo and I do not want any other changes except an anime profile. I could not find a forked Dictionarry repo which fit that need.



## What I Built



This repo is an up-to-date Dictionarry repo (auto-pull enabled) with the addition of the [anime profile](https://github.com/sweatyeggs69/profilarr/blob/stable/profiles/Anime%201080p.yml) built by [Sweaty Eggs](https://github.com/sweatyeggs69/profilarr). What you are getting here is a **100% unaltered** Dictionarry repo with the addition of a single amime quality profile.





## How it Works





This repo is constructed using a GitHub workflow. The workflow checks to see if there are any changes to the Dictionarry repo and pulls them here. It also checks the anime profile from Sweaty Eggs (and its dependencies) and pulls **only those changes** here while leaving the rest of his repo alone. So basically every day this is a fully updated Dictionarry repo with a fully updated anime profile.





## Help?





This only exists because there are no anime profiles in Dictionarry. Once there is one, I will probably delete this repo. I will tell you I do not watch anime, so if someone out there with more expertise than me knows how this should go, please let me know!
