# Servers@Home Profilarr Database
Hey everyone. We have had a lot of questions about anime profiles within Profilarr since once does not exist. The devs of Profilarr have created a function in which I can publish my local Profilarr changes to this repo!

## Why Does This Exist?
My issue with getting a pre-existing anime quality profile from someone else is that I want to remain true to the Dictionarry philosophy but with the small addition of anime for those who need it. With someone else's repo, I have to use their **entire** repo and I do not want any other changes except an anime profile. I could not find a forked Dictionarry repo which fit that need.

## What I Built

This repo is an up-to-date Dictionarry repo (auto-pull enabled) with the addition of the [anime profile](https://github.com/sweatyeggs69/profilarr/blob/stable/profiles/Anime%201080p.yml) built by [Sweaty Eggs](https://github.com/sweatyeggs69/profilarr).
