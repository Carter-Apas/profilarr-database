name: 1080p Encode
description: This profile aims to provide a balance between quality, size and compatibility
  by prioritising 'Transparent' encodes through a special metric known as the Golden
  Popcorn Performance Index. This is a data-driven metric that identifies and ranks
  release groups based on their propensity to release a 'Golden Pocorn' - a very high
  quality encode. Special considerations for audio, sources, extras and flags are
  also used to help rank releases.
