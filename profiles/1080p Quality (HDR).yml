description: "1080p Quality (HDR) utilizes the [**Golden Popcorn Performance Index**](https://dictionarry.dev/wiki/GPPi)\
  \ to target **transparent x265 HDR** 1080p encodes. \n- 5 Quality tiers prioritise\
  \ encodes with high 1080p GPPi scores, with fallback to the regular 1080p Quality\
  \ profile (non HDR), then 1080p WEB-DLs and streaming optimised encodes (**BHDStudio\
  \ & hallowed**).\n- **x265 is negated** but allowed, if and only if a reputable\
  \ GPPi group has encoded it from a UHD Bluray source.\n- Non HDR x265 encodes are\
  \ strictly forbidden in this profile\n- If no 1080p release can be found, the profile\
  \ will fall back to SD releases - **DVD remuxes  / encodes**"
