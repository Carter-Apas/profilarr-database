description: "2160p Remux utilizes **audio / video tags** to prioritise high quality\
  \ lossless copies of UHD Blu-rays.\n\n- Unlike the encode profiles, which target\
  \ releases based on a release group metric, 2160p Remux avoids this to stop *circular\
  \ downloads* where no discernable upgrade is found. \n- Instead, audio / video metrics\
  \ such Dolby Vision, TrueHD, Atmos, HDR10+, etc are used to indicate when a remux\
  \ should be upgraded.\n- For instance, if a hybrid remux that includes some WEB\
  \ DoVi layer is released, it will be upgraded over the standard non hybrid release,\
  \ regardless of release group.\n- This also helps to grab non group tagged remuxes,\
  \ which are fairly common on quite a few trackers who often have the best remux\
  \ available. \n- If no 2160p Remux cannot be found, the profile falls back to **2160p\
  \ WEB-DLs**.\n- If a 2160p WEB-DL cannot be found, the profile falls back to the\
  \ **1080p Remux** profile. "
